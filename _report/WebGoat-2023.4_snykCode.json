The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","Deserialization","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpParam","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/rdrey/LoBReTiMMGaP/commit/e4f63073a593c7c8b7a4fada9a47c364e87177d2?diff=split#diff-8af010b0efb53da5ddef9791690aafa488a1293eae0e1ee4d342eb5a695c7eb9L-1","lines": [{"line": "in = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n","lineNumber": 48,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "in = socket.getInputStream();\n","lineNumber": 54,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/debezium/debezium-incubator/commit/f63fc9135ad7225b2e01b79bab0933e52e328639?diff=split#diff-4f79624db1bcaacfd2db3678cbf647fae1647c9bdfa0d0682b5640f991fc101aL-1","lines": [{"line": "Map<String, Object> props = new Yaml().load(fis);\n","lineNumber": 56,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "Properties props = new Properties();\n","lineNumber": 56,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "props.load(fis);\n","lineNumber": 57,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "fis.close();\n","lineNumber": 58,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/dataspread/dataspread-web/commit/660e5d304050ddb44c1c8c6a6da4d60557e1ebbc?diff=split#diff-265fdf7f44a6ed48947f623af118676d522093203c3a578ca4b5044f9521efb8L-1","lines": [{"line": "ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n","lineNumber": 221,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "if (rs.next()) {\n","lineNumber": 222,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    if (useKryo) {\n","lineNumber": 223,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        Input in = new Input(rs.getBytes(1));\n","lineNumber": 224,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        Integer block_id = kryo.readObject(in, Integer.class);\n","lineNumber": 225,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        in.close();\n","lineNumber": 226,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        result.add(block_id);\n","lineNumber": 227,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    } else {\n","lineNumber": 228,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n","lineNumber": 229,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        String value = new String(rs.getBytes(1));\n","lineNumber": 230,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        mapper.disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES);\n","lineNumber": 231,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        Integer block_id = mapper.readValue(value, Integer.class);\n","lineNumber": 232,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        result.add(block_id);\n","lineNumber": 233,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    }\n","lineNumber": 234,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "while (rs.next()) {\n","lineNumber": 222,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    result.add(Integer.valueOf(new String(rs.getBytes(1))));\n","lineNumber": 223,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 32,"cwe": ["CWE-502"]}},{"id": "java/HttpResponseSplitting","name": "HttpResponseSplitting","shortDescription": {"text": "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "warning"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nCRLF is an abbreviation for the terms \"carriage return\" and \"line feed.\" These two special characters are a legacy of old-fashioned printing terminals used in the early days of computing. However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks. These include GET, POST, cookies, and other HTTP headers.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","HttpResponseSplitting","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpBody","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-community-packaging/commit/8af011cd6d21a02716d4df9de815deabc47276c1?diff=split#diff-9104c59dc0f2f6f14a574eddd04b18fde626ce21e8152cfc230916ebf1a87d0dL-1","lines": [{"line": "String encname = filename.replace('%', '=');\r\n","lineNumber": 175,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "res.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment;filename=\\\"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?\" + encname + \"?=\\\"\");\r\n","lineNumber": 176,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "res.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment\");\r\n","lineNumber": 173,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-backend/commit/89e32cfb780c5e40e4cbf07f4dcd3fb4bfd979f1?diff=split#diff-d3ba533a52eea865843e214ed943a20e14ba581be384e32e53fbe8e92d737e58L-1","lines": [{"line": "\t\t\tresponse.addHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", request.getHeader(\"origin\"));\n","lineNumber": 43,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\t\t\tresponse.addHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", sanitizeOriginUrl(request.getHeader(\"origin\")));\n","lineNumber": 43,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\t\t}\n","lineNumber": 44,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 45,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t\tfilterChain.doFilter(request, response);\n","lineNumber": 46,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t}\n","lineNumber": 47,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 48,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\tprivate String sanitizeOriginUrl(String originUrl) {\n","lineNumber": 49,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\t\treturn originUrl.replaceAll(\"[\\n\\r]+\",\" \");\n","lineNumber": 50,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\t}\n","lineNumber": 51,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/zjhch123/Tears/commit/5c13ae033c4123124e66f506a4a3d7e603ae63c4?diff=split#diff-ce66044802535339583b5865e14f2502b9ed461a1114f1764934517a0f1afe99L-1","lines": [{"line": "            res.setHeader(\"Set-Cookie\", cookies);\n","lineNumber": 82,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            this.mappingCookie(res, cookies);\n","lineNumber": 98,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        }\n","lineNumber": 99,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    }\n","lineNumber": 100,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 101,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    private void mappingCookie(Response res, List<String> cookies) {\n","lineNumber": 102,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        List<String> mappingCookie = new ArrayList<>();\n","lineNumber": 103,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        for(String cookie : cookies) {\n","lineNumber": 104,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "            if(cookie.contains(\"Path\")) {\n","lineNumber": 105,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                boolean isHTTPOnly = cookie.contains(\"HttpOnly\");\n","lineNumber": 106,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                String cookieStr = cookie.substring(0, cookie.indexOf(\"Path=\"));\n","lineNumber": 107,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                String path = \"/\";\n","lineNumber": 108,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\"Path=((.*);\\\\s?|(.*))\");\n","lineNumber": 109,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                Matcher m = p.matcher(cookie);\n","lineNumber": 110,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                while(m.find()) {\n","lineNumber": 111,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    if(m.group(2) == null) {\n","lineNumber": 112,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                        path = m.group(3);\n","lineNumber": 113,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    } else {\n","lineNumber": 114,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                        path = m.group(2);\n","lineNumber": 115,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    }\n","lineNumber": 116,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                }\n","lineNumber": 117,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                path = cookieMapping.getOrDefault(path, path);\n","lineNumber": 118,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                cookieStr = cookieStr + \"Path=\" + path + (isHTTPOnly ?

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value.

Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","InsecureHash","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/commit/923a232cad8649ab52fa29015a6ca44d75e9bed9?diff=split#diff-8dd0667225c4115f53422781dae52c5bae769e6620add28ba7c555f7b593b4d0L-1","lines": [{"line": "MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-1\");\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-512\");\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/commit/0f81a03ae3f907922a05167688dadc8c3e3fbfb8?diff=split#diff-801c01409e6adce75757fddee032ee993bc0d54328d0632f7d728689a4b8effdL-1","lines": [{"line": "return DigestUtils.md5Hex(screenshotData) + \".png\";\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "return DigestUtils.sha256Hex(screenshotData) + \".png\";\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/commit/6f426dae8a4bb657b0dda6a447cf2245c6ad4a24?diff=split#diff-9392c6fa9a5c8dda13494b2cd8b5e818a5fe05cdcec4264245cc1456f5e7494eL-1","lines": [{"line": "HashCode expected = HashCode.fromString(new String(Files.asByteSource(sha1File).read(), UTF_8));\n","lineNumber": 119,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "HashCode expected =\n","lineNumber": 121,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    HashCode.fromString(new String(Files.asByteSource(sha512File).read(), UTF_8));\n","lineNumber": 122,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 152,"cwe": ["CWE-916"]}},{"id": "java/InsecureSecret","name": "InsecureSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Use of Insufficiently Random Values - Secrets"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nComputer security relies on random numbers for many things: generating secure, confidential session keys; hashing password data; encryption for transmitting sensitive data, and more. It's easy to understand why. If session keys, for example, were generated sequentially, attackers would be able to guess these easily and then hijack legitimate user sessions. Similarly, if encryption techniques used easy-to-guess numbers, attackers could use brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.\n\nIn reality, since computers cannot generate truly random numbers, they use \"pseudorandom\" numbers instead, generated using an algorithm that is \"seeded\" in a variety of ways to produce highly variable values in a random-seeming order, making them very hard-in theory-for attackers to guess. However, if developers inadvertently make use of a weak random algorithm, attackers may be able to discover the algorithm, seed, or pattern, ultimately unlocking access to commands or sensitive data, which can then be held for ransom or sold.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using weak pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), such as statistical PRNGs. Instead, choose a cryptographically secure PRNG.\n* Avoid using predictable seed values, such as user ID or server start time. Instead, use a seed that is itself pseudorandom, such as one taken from an external hardware source.\n* Use standard, accepted security algorithms and libraries rather than taking a DIY approach and creating custom code that may contain inherent weaknesses or overlook critical flaws.\n* Use static analysis tools to identify potential instances of this weakness in code and then ensure good test coverage with appropriate white-box testing.\n* Educate developers about the importance of entropy in security systems development, and consider adopting tools that are FIPS 140-2 compliant.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","InsecureSecret","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/adrian/upm-swing/commit/e27b794a3ac1a4e25a8f03b436f4e72430cce57b?diff=split#diff-a692680a02fef754cebcdb780e87d9f352c7626e8a5331b2325b6650c130db49L-1","lines": [{"line": "import java.util.Random;\r\n","lineNumber": 34,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 35,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "import java.security.SecureRandom;\r\n","lineNumber": 34,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "import javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException;\r\n","lineNumber": 36,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "import javax.crypto.BadPaddingException;\r\n","lineNumber": 37,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "import java.io.File;\r\n","lineNumber": 38,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\r\n","lineNumber": 39,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 40,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 41,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "public class EncryptionService {\r\n","lineNumber": 42,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 43,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\tprivate Cipher encryptionCipher; \r\n","lineNumber": 44,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\tprivate Cipher decryptionCipher;\r\n","lineNumber": 45,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\tprivate byte[] salt;\r\n","lineNumber": 46,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 47,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\tpublic static final int SALT_LENGTH = 8;\r\n","lineNumber": 48,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\r\n","lineNumber": 49,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t//Would prefer if I could use AES or Twofish here.

Traversal"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "warning"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19

If the password is reused across different environments or applications, the compromise can spread quickly and broadly.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","HardcodedPassword","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/clowee/OpenSZZ-Cloud-Native/commit/ee429faf9d384074cf33515eda2a52e4e85ef061?diff=split#diff-a125fdf9d37b8daa4d9f0a7a46aedd416a80a49936bdee4bae40db3f3eef22deL-1","lines": [{"line": "final String username = \"noreply.openszz@gmail.com\";\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "final String password = \"Aa30011992\";\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "final String username = System.getenv(\"EMAIL\");\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "final String password = System.getenv(\"PWD\");\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/winstonli/writelatex-git-bridge/commit/1117c70f31cee7d9a84c565c143f353d8bbab19e?diff=split#diff-16d090e60dcd386546c2164ae454bd356cbf326d715a66796582e8c003d8af10L-1","lines": [{"line": "    public static void setBasicAuth(String username, String password) {\n","lineNumber": 27,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        USERNAME = username;\n","lineNumber": 28,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        PASSWORD = password;\n","lineNumber": 29,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    }\n","lineNumber": 30,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 31,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    public static void setBaseURL(String baseURL) {\n","lineNumber": 32,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        BASE_URL = baseURL;\n","lineNumber": 33,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    }\n","lineNumber": 34,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 35,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/CheckChe0803/flink-recommandSystem-demo/commit/bbe348d12bc76858d8c0878f2a89ccc0f1e7b05b?diff=split#diff-7cac3b1a67764486d11265840a420739f0339a6cc8ff947d192de102366f8acaL-1","lines": [{"line": "private static String URL = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost/con?serverTimezone=GMT%2B8\";\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "private static String NAME = \"root\";\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "private static String PASS = \"root\";\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "private static String URL = Property.getStrValue(\"mysql.url\");\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "private static String NAME = Property.getStrValue(\"mysql.name\");\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "private static String PASS = Property.getStrValue(\"mysql.pass\");\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "private static Statement stmt;\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "static {\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    try {\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "        Class.forName(\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\");\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, NAME, PASS);\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "none"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 74,"cwe": ["CWE-798","CWE-259"]}},{"id": "java/PT/test","name": "PT/test","shortDescription": {"text": "Path Traversal"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "note"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19

{"markdown": "\n## Details\nA timing attack is a form of side-channel attack, meaning it does not take advantage of the way the code is structured, but rather exploits external clues that let an attacker infer the program's state. In a timing attack, program state is inferred from the time it takes to execute a particular operation. For example, an app might use a lookup table of valid session IDs to speed up access.\nWhile this is convenient for validated users, an invalid session ID will take far longer to be rejected (since it's not in the lookup table), giving the attackers a valuable way to engineer a brute-force attack. All they need to do is test a large number of randomly generated session IDs in the hope of discovering a valid one. Once access is granted, through the session ID, the malicious actor may impersonate a legitimate user, executing actions or freely accessing secure data. Through brute force, such as a massive bot attack, this weakness can be successfully exploited to bypass even very strong encryption algorithms.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Implement a constant-time algorithm to ensure that timing is identical regardless of input validity and returned outcome.\n* If a constant-time algorithm is impractical due to a desire to optimize performance, choose another technique such as blinding.\n* Promote an awareness among developers that encryption is not enough if your app is giving off clues to help attackers.\n* Timing attacks often depend on the production environment and are thus difficult to test during development; be sure to use a staging environment as close as possible to production.\n* Choose hardened, reliable libraries for encryption and authentication with side-channel attack protection strategies rather than implementing your own methods.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags":

The payload may be delivered by the server or other channels, but—unlike reflected or stored XSS—the server does not perform the injection/echo that triggers execution; the critical issue is a tainted data flow from source to sink within client-side logic, which traditional server-side defenses and many WAFs often miss.\n\nEffective mitigation of DOM XSS vulnerabilities requires implementing comprehensive input validation and output encoding strategies specifically designed for client‑side execution contexts. This includes establishing strict allowlisting mechanisms for user‑controllable data, implementing context‑aware output encoding based on the specific DOM operation being performed, and adopting secure coding practices that minimize the attack surface exposed through dangerous DOM/JavaScript APIs. Additionally, modern web applications should leverage Content Security Policy (CSP) directives and other browser security features to establish defense‑in‑depth protections against DOM‑based attacks.\n\nDOM XSS attacks have been extensively documented in security research and are frequently exploited to achieve various malicious objectives, including session hijacking through cookie theft, credential harvesting via phishing attacks, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users, client‑side malware distribution, and sensitive data exfiltration. The client‑side nature of these attacks makes them effective at bypassing traditional perimeter security controls and targeting users directly within their browser environment.\n\n### Types of attacks\n\n| Type                         | Source Category          | Description                                                                                                                                         | Technical Details                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **URL Parameter Injection**  | Navigation               | Malicious payloads embedded within URL query parameters that are processed by vulnerable JavaScript code accessing `location.search` or similar properties. | Commonly exploits `URLSearchParams`, direct string parsing, or framework routing mechanisms that unsafely process query parameters (including History API updates like `pushState`). |\n| **Fragment Identifier Exploitation** | Navigation       | Attack vectors utilizing URL hash fragments (`#`) that are accessible through `location.hash` and processed by client‑side routing or content loading mechanisms. | Particularly prevalent in Single Page Applications (SPAs) with client‑side routing frameworks that process hash‑based navigation.                                                       |\n| **HTTP Referrer Manipulation** | Request Context       | Exploitation of `document.referrer` values that contain malicious payloads, typically originating from attacker‑controlled websites linking to the vulnerable application. | Requires social engineering to direct users from attacker‑controlled domains with crafted referrer values.                                                                            |\n| **Browser Storage Attacks**  | Persistent Storage       | Malicious data injection into `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or IndexedDB that is subsequently read and processed unsafely by application JavaScript.    | Can persist across sessions if the attacker can get data stored (via another bug or social engineering) and may be combined with other vectors for staged exploitation.               |\n| **Cross-Frame Communication** | Inter-Frame Messaging   | Exploitation of `postMessage` APIs where malicious data is transmitted between frames or windows and processed without proper origin validation and input sanitization. | Common in applications with embedded iframes or popup windows that implement cross‑origin communication mechanisms.                                                                    |\n| **WebSocket Message Injection** | Real-time Communication | Malicious payloads delivered through WebSocket connections that are processed by client‑side message handlers without adequate input validation.         | Particularly effective against real‑time applications like chat systems, collaborative tools, or live data feeds.                                                                       |\n\n### Affected environments\n\nDOM XSS vulnerabilities can impact various categories of web applications and client‑side environments:\n\n- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** utilizing frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or custom JavaScript implementations\n- **Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)** with extensive client‑side functionality and offline capabilities\n- **Client‑side routing implementations** including hash‑based and HTML5 History API routing mechanisms\n- **Browser extensions and add‑ons** with content script injection and web page interaction capabilities\n- **Hybrid mobile applications** utilizing WebView components and JavaScript bridge implementations\n- **Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)** with complex client‑side business logic and DOM manipulation\n- **Content Management Systems (CMS)** with client-side editing interfaces and dynamic content rendering\n- **Social media platforms and widgets** implementing client‑side content embedding and sharing functionality\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\nThis section outlines comprehensive security measures designed to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities through secure development practices and technical controls.\n\n### Input Validation and Sanitization\n\n- **Implement strict input validation** for all client‑side data sources including URL parameters, fragment identifiers, referrer values, storage mechanisms, and cross‑frame communications using allowlisting approaches rather than blacklisting methodologies.\n- **Establish contextual output encoding** appropriate for the specific DOM context where data will be utilized, including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript string escaping, CSS value encoding, and URL parameter encoding.\n- **Validate data origin and integrity** for cross‑frame `postMessage` communications by implementing strict origin checking and message format validation to prevent malicious data injection from untrusted sources.\n- **Sanitize persistent storage data** by validating all data retrieved from `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or other client‑side storage mechanisms before processing or rendering within the application.\n\n### Secure DOM Manipulation Practices\n\n- **Avoid high‑risk DOM sinks** including `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write()`, `document.writeln()`, `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with string arguments when processing user‑controllable data.\n- **Utilize safer DOM manipulation methods** such as `textContent`, `createTextNode()`, and DOM element creation APIs that do not interpret content as executable code. Use `setAttribute()` only for non‑URL/non‑event attributes and never to set `on*` handlers or dangerous URL attributes from untrusted data.\n- **Implement secure templating mechanisms** using frameworks or libraries that provide automatic output encoding and XSS protection rather than manual string concatenation for dynamic content generation.\n- **Enforce separation of data and code** by avoiding the construction of JavaScript code through string concatenation with user‑controllable data and utilizing structured data formats like JSON for data transmission.\n\n### Browser Security Feature Implementation\n\n- **Deploy comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP)** directives (e.g., `script-src`, `object-src`, `base-uri`, `frame-ancestors`) to limit script execution and reduce impact if a DOM XSS exists.\n- **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)** for all external JavaScript resources to prevent tampering with third‑party libraries that could introduce DOM XSS vulnerabilities.\n- **Utilize HTTP security headers** including `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (if CSP is not available) `X-Frame-Options`, while preferring CSP’s `frame-ancestors` directive for clickjacking protection.\n- **Adopt modern browser defenses** such as Trusted Types (where supported) to prevent assignment to DOM sinks unless passed through an approved sanitizer. Treat CORS as an access-control mechanism—not a DOM XSS control—and configure it appropriately to limit unnecessary cross-origin data exposure.\n\n### Development and Testing Practices\n\n- **Conduct regular security code reviews** focusing specifically on client-side data flow analysis to identify potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities during the development process.\n- **Implement automated static analysis** using specialized tools capable of detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript code and identifying unsafe data flows from sources to sinks.\n- **Perform dynamic application security testing (DAST)** with specialized DOM XSS detection capabilities and manual penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.\n- **Establish secure coding guidelines** for development teams including training on DOM XSS attack vectors, secure JavaScript programming practices, and proper use of security‑focused libraries and frameworks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","DOMXSS","Security","SourceNonServer","SourceResourceAccess","SourceNetworkRequest","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/codice/ddf/commit/a8c54db08a09e8104443fd8531c0f8b6cffda1c7?diff=split#diff-e3bb069f9efbc30d0207a7c690710bc5a3b2acac15a5b8425e622a88e63a41cdL-1","lines": [{"line": "$('#extramessage').html(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' ')));\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "$('#extramessage').text(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' '))).html();\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Drive4ik/simple-tab-groups/commit/d23caa02378845671eb32ee2c43c368f857b47c3?diff=split#diff-efdba41d528998f946ce1103fa57532e3746b2e9b1984cb92c94a2526451aedbL-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerHTML = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerText = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mykter/TagTime-desktop/commit/684351457a3299047fa60563785aa1716df00888?diff=split#diff-821c318e2a22a1360159993ee2168341f78e7567d0b1c9996a76f3e0cfb27b26L-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").innerHTML =\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").textContent = moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 227,"cwe": ["CWE-79"]}},{"id": "java/HardcodedPassword/test","name": "HardcodedPassword/test","shortDescription": {"text": "Use of Hardcoded Passwords"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "note"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nDevelopers may use hardcoded passwords during development to streamline setup or simplify authentication while testing.

This is done under fairly limited conditions through an exception to the same origin policy known as \"cross-origin resource sharing\".\n\nDevelopers may create definitions of trusted domains that are broader than absolutely necessary, inadvertently opening up wider access than intended. This weakness could result in data exposure or loss, or even allow an attacker to take over the site or application.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using wildcards for cross-origin resource sharing. Instead, define intended domains explicitly.\n* Ensure that your site or app is well defended against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), which could lead to takeover via an overly permissive cross-domain policy.\n* Do not mix secure and insecure protocols when defining cross-domain policies.\n* Consider defining a clear approved list to specify which domains will be given resource-level access; use this approved list to validate all domain access requests.\n* Clearly define which methods (view, read, and update) are permitted for each resource and domain to avoid abuse.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","TooPermissiveCorsPostMessage","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/PaulKinlan/WebIntents/commit/41d1105fbe9d18d372ec852cb58e5e78f23964a6?diff=split#diff-d05c7b81a085e6ddd6c2cfdd9e2ab94c0181a147e87e261dab701b3cc3ec1092L-1","lines": [{"line": "window.postMessage(JSON.stringify(data), \"*\");\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "window.postMessage(JSON.stringify(data), document.location.origin);\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/amaurymartiny/timed/commit/18668e64030553d56f148d4c874198ff0a8d158d?diff=split#diff-ca76b7bbd1ab4de12f0fa9db1dde80564fd30390db4985737c52bb9ceb079385L-1","lines": [{"line": "window.postMessage({ action: 'GET_TRACKED_TIME' }, '*')\n","lineNumber": 37,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "window.postMessage({ action: 'GET_TRACKED_TIME', source: 'webapp' }, process.env.HOST)\n","lineNumber": 37,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/web-eid/web-eid-extension/commit/39fbefaa74fb4be7638bb6c2f0c335c29bb7d08a?diff=split#diff-fdf8b5debf9c89396c9ca4a891fdae30f77d7ad42973678b396e799882537c56L-1","lines": [{"line": "window.postMessage(request, '*');\n","lineNumber": 44,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "window.postMessage(request, location.origin);\n","lineNumber": 44,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 67,"cwe": ["CWE-942"]}},{"id": "javascript/UnsafeJqueryPlugin","name": "UnsafeJqueryPlugin","shortDescription": {"text": "Unsafe JQuery Plugin"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "note"},"help": {"markdown": "\n# Details\n\nPopular frameworks, such as JQuery, may be extended by with third party plugins.\nA third party plug-in might, for example, add an additional function to the JQuery framework.\nSuch a function might accept parameters from the client (the developer using the plugin).\n\nClients of these plugins do not know the details of the plugin's implementation, so the inputs and outputs should be documented by the plugin developer.\n\nOf particular importance, the plugin developer should document whether a particular input should be sanitized by the client.\n\nThe JQuery framework exposes an API that consists of the following:\n- Methods that use some input to select an element within the DOM\n- Methods that use some input to mutate the DOM\n\nAs a result, a plugin might, for example, take user input and write it to the DOM without sanitizing it internally, expecting the client to have performed the necessary sanitization.\nThis case may lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilties.\n\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\n\n* Document which inputs should be sanitized\n  * It's recommended that JQuery plugin developers thoroughly document any inputs that may lead to cross-side scripting attacks.\n\n* Avoid ambiguous JQuery APIs\n  In addition to the onus of documentation, JQuery plugin developers should take particular care to ensure that user input is not handled in unexpected ways.\n  * JQuery has a very flexible API, and there are some methods that either perform a selection OR mutation, depending on the type of input given.\n  * As a result, a plugin developer may intend their plugin to accept user input to perform a selection, but certain user inputs may instead perform dynamic HTML construction.\n  * If user input is intended to only be used to perform selection, a method that only performs selection should be used","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","UnsafeJqueryPlugin","Security","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 0,"cwe": ["CWE-79","CWE-116"]}},{"id": "javascript/WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault","name": "WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault","shortDescription": {"text": "Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "note"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nIn a session hijacking attack, if a cookie containing sensitive data is set without the `secure` attribute, an attacker might be able to intercept that cookie. Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/cmilfont/biohacking/commit/d034909675024ef5cbdee75e2ec14e7a89caa1f4?diff=split#diff-a4c65ede64197e1a112899a68bf994485b889c4b143198bac4af53425b38406fL-1","lines": [{"line": "cookie: {\n","lineNumber": 32,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  maxAge: 60000,\n","lineNumber": 33,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  domain,\n","lineNumber": 34,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  secure: true,\n","lineNumber": 35,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/sahava/GoogleTagManagerTemplates_site/commit/d61e1e054c79a7a6da38869819d6fa3a27fc48a0?diff=split#diff-5518f6a4122fcd2aee3d829253b3f89262461ec1d5127af437853ae173862043L-1","lines": [{"line": "  try {\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const idToken = req.body.idToken.toString();\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    // Set session cookie settings\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const expiresIn = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 5;\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const options = {maxAge: expiresIn, httpOnly: true};\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    const options = {maxAge: expiresIn, httpOnly: true, secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'};\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    const sessionCookie = await app.auth().createSessionCookie(idToken, {expiresIn});\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    res.cookie('session', sessionCookie, options);\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon/commit/9bb8e8ca86c152c32e3070994c34d3e1923d7d2a?diff=split#diff-ae9b91456b11c181adfefe3d9f1966931be9926c98a4ed0390ef82cf38be6fe9L-1","lines": [{"line": "res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken(), { httpOnly: false });\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var cookieOptions = { httpOnly: false };\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if(process.env.NODE_ENV != 'development' && process.env.NODE_ENV) {\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    cookieOptions.secure = true;\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "} else {\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    require('../config/loggers.config').logger.error({security: true}, 'secure anti-XSRF cookie flag was false - should only happen in dev environments');\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken(), cookieOptions);\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 50,"cwe": ["CWE-614"]}},{"id": "java/HardcodedSecret","name": "HardcodedSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Hardcoded Secret"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nWhen constants are hardcoded into applications, this information could easily be reverse-engineered and become known to attackers.
